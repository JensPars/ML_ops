Excercises that needed to be completed with a model  framework (e.g inference, traing etc.) (such as docker, pytest etc.) have been completed in the demo_cookiecutter directory, the rest can be found in the respective weeks folder, under /excercises.

Note that I had gcloud install issues, thus most of the cloud excercises have been ommitted from this repo. However I followed along with Anders Parslov's implementation, who did not have the same issues.
